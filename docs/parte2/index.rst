Sizes of electrical cables is a library made in the Python programming language and was created in order to shorten the time in the sizing of electrical conductors or obtaining the sections of the conductors of an electrical installation.

The library currently has 8 modules that are internally called to perform the dimensioning of low voltage conductors for commercial conductors from 600 V to 2000 V, the results obtained are shown in matrix or table form for a better understanding of the results.
